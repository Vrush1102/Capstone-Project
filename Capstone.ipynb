    "    - Conduct a comprehensive funnel analysis to ascertain campaign acceptance rates.\n",
    "    - Investigate the influence of income levels on expenditure across various product categories.\n",
    "    - Test the hypothesis suggesting that recent customers exhibit lower complaint rates compared to established customers.\n",
    "    - Explore the correlation between customer responses across multiple campaigns.\n",
    "    - Profile customers who exhibit positive response behaviors in marketing campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
